            This order shall dispose of the application filed by the Petitioner under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, seeking ad-interim relief against the Respondents. The proceedings record of this case indicates a sequence of events pertinent to the current application, which are consolidated and summarized herein for clarity and adjudication.

                        The present petition was filed and listed for the first time before this Court. Arguments on admission were heard. The petition is admitted. Let notice be issued to all Respondents. The registry is directed to serve notice through all permissible modes, including electronic mail and registered post with acknowledgement due (A.D.). Dasti service is also permitted. The matter is listed for further proceedings.

Let the same be filed within four weeks from today, with an advance copy to the counsel for the Petitioner. Rejoinder, if any, be filed within two weeks thereafter. The matter is listed for hearing on the next date.

                    <td>
                        The court has heard the learned counsel for the Petitioner on the application for interim relief. It is argued by the Petitioner that failure to grant interim relief would result in irreparable harm and render the main petition infructuous. After considering the submissions from both parties and reviewing the documents on record, this Court is of the prima facie view that the Petitioner has made out a case for the grant of interim relief. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Petitioner. Accordingly, interim relief is granted as prayed for in paragraph [X] of the application. This order is subject to the Petitioner furnishing an undertaking within one week, affirming that they shall compensate the Respondents for any damages suffered should the main petition ultimately be decided against them.

        <h3>Final Directions</h3>
        <p>
            In view of the above, the application for interim relief stands disposed of. The main matter, CS(OS) 52/2018, shall be listed for completion of pleadings and further directions on the next scheduled date of hearing, 05-08-2024.
