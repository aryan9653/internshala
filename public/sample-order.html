            <dl class="case-type-list">
                <dt>W.P.(C) - Writ Petition (Civil)</dt>
                <dd>A Writ Petition (Civil) is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in a High Court. It is used to seek remedy when a citizen's fundamental rights are violated by the state or a government authority. It is a powerful tool for judicial review of administrative actions. Common writs include Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Certiorari, Prohibition, and Quo Warranto.</dd>

                <dt>CS(OS) - Civil Suit (Original Side)</dt>
                <dd>A Civil Suit (Original Side) refers to a lawsuit of a civil nature that is filed directly in the High Court, bypassing the lower district courts. The High Courts of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai have 'Original Jurisdiction' to hear such cases, typically involving high-value financial disputes, intellectual property rights (like patents and trademarks), or complex commercial matters.</dd>

                <dt>FAO - First Appeal from Order</dt>
                <dd>A First Appeal from Order is an appeal filed against an order passed by a lower court or tribunal that is not a final judgment or decree. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, specifies which orders are appealable. This allows parties to challenge interim or procedural orders before the case is finally decided.</dd>
                
                <dt>CRL.A - Criminal Appeal</dt>
                <dd>A Criminal Appeal is an appeal filed in a higher court against the judgment or order of a lower court in a criminal case. This can be an appeal against a conviction (filed by the accused) or an appeal against an acquittal (filed by the state or the victim). The purpose is to review the lower court's decision for errors of law or fact.</dd>
