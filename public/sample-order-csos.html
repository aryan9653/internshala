            <h2>Understanding a Civil Suit (Original Side) - CS(OS)</h2>
            <p>A <strong>Civil Suit (Original Side)</strong> means the High Court is hearing the case for the first time, similar to a trial court. This happens for civil matters of high pecuniary (monetary) value. In Delhi, suits where the value of the dispute is over a certain threshold (e.g., â‚¹2 crore) are filed directly in the High Court. 'Original Jurisdiction' is the power to hear a case from its inception, as opposed to 'Appellate Jurisdiction,' which is the power to review a lower court's decision. These suits cover disputes related to contracts, property, intellectual property rights, etc.</p>

            <h2>Orders of the Court</h2>
            
            <div class="order-item">
                <strong>Application for summary judgment dismissed</strong>
                <p class="meta">Type: order | Date: 15-07-2024</p>
                <p>The application filed by the Plaintiff under Order XIIIA for summary judgment is dismissed. The court is of the view that there are triable issues that require leading of evidence. The case will now proceed to trial as per the regular procedure.</p>
                <div class="purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> A summary judgment is a request to decide the case without a full trial, arguing that the other party has no real prospect of succeeding. By dismissing this application, the court has decided that the defendant's case has enough merit to warrant a full trial where evidence will be presented and witnesses examined. This is a setback for the plaintiff who hoped for a quick resolution.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="order-item">
                <strong>Summons issued to defendant</strong>
                <p class="meta">Type: notice | Date: 10-05-2024</p>
                <p>Summons to be served upon the defendant through all permissible modes. The defendant is directed to file a written statement within 30 days of the receipt of summons. The parties are also directed to file their affidavits of admission/denial of documents.</p>
                 <div class="purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This is the initial step after a suit is filed. The court officially notifies the defendant about the lawsuit and commands them to appear and defend their case. The 'written statement' is the defendant's formal reply to the plaintiff's allegations. This order ensures that the legal process is followed and both parties have a chance to present their side of the story.</p>
