            <h2>Understanding a First Appeal from Order (FAO)</h2>
            <p>A <strong>First Appeal from Order (FAO)</strong> is an appeal filed against an 'order' of a lower court, as distinguished from a 'decree' (which is a final judgment). Certain specific orders passed during the course of a suit can be appealed immediately, without waiting for the final outcome of the case. A very common example is an appeal against an order granting or refusing a temporary injunction. This allows a party who is negatively affected by an interim order to seek immediate relief from a higher court.</p>

            <h2>Orders of the Court</h2>
            
            <div class="order-item">
                <strong>Stay on lower court order</strong>
                <p class="meta">Type: order | Date: 25-07-2024</p>
                <p>The operation of the impugned order of the trial court dated [date] is stayed till the next date of hearing. The appellant shall, however, maintain accounts of the sales of the disputed product and file them in court.</p>
                <div class="purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This is a significant interim victory for the appellant. The High Court has temporarily paused ('stayed') the effect of the lower court's injunction order. This means the appellant (Creative Designs Inc.) can likely resume its activities that were stopped by the trial court. However, the condition to 'maintain accounts' ensures that if the appellant ultimately loses the appeal, the financial benefit they gained during the stay period can be calculated and potentially compensated to the respondent.</p>

                <p class="meta">Type: notice | Date: 20-06-2024</p>
                <p>Issue notice of the appeal to the respondent, returnable on the next date. The appellant is directed to provide a copy of the appeal paper book to the respondent's counsel within one week.</p>
                 <div class="purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This is the first step in the appeal, where the High Court formally informs the respondent (the party who won in the lower court) that an appeal has been filed against the order. This ensures the respondent is aware of the proceedings and has an opportunity to appear and defend the lower court's order. It upholds the principle of 'audi alteram partem' (hear the other side).</p>
