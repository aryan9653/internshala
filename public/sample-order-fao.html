            <h2>Understanding FAO - First Appeal from Order</h2>
            <p>A First Appeal from Order (FAO) is an appeal filed in a higher court (here, the High Court) against an order passed by a lower court (the 'trial court') in a civil case. It is not an appeal against the final judgment, but rather against a specific interim (temporary) order passed during the proceedings. In this case, the appellant is challenging a temporary injunction, which likely restricted them from doing something.</p>

            <h2>Orders of the Court</h2>
            
            <div class="order-item">
                <p class="order-meta">Title: Stay on lower court order | Type: order | Date: 25-07-2024</p>
                <p>The operation of the impugned order dated [Trial Court Order Date] passed by the Ld. Additional District Judge is stayed till the next date of hearing. The appellant has made out a prima facie case for the grant of interim relief.</p>
                <div class="order-purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> A 'stay' order temporarily freezes the effect of the lower court's decision. Here, the High Court believes the appellant (Creative Designs Inc.) has a strong initial argument. To prevent irreparable harm to the appellant while the appeal is being decided, the High Court has paused the lower court's injunction. This is a significant temporary victory for the appellant.</p>

            <div class="order-item">
                <p class="order-meta">Title: Notice of appeal | Type: notice | Date: 20-06-2024</p>
                <p>Issue notice of the appeal to the respondent, returnable on 25-07-2024. The appellant is directed to provide a copy of the appeal paper book to the respondent.</p>
                <div class="order-purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This is the formal communication to the other party (the respondent) that an appeal has been filed against the lower court's order which was in their favor. It ensures they are aware of the appeal and have a chance to appear and defend the lower court's decision. It is the first step in the appellate process.</p>
