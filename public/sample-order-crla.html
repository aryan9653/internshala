            <h4>What is a Criminal Appeal (CRL.A)?</h4>
            <p>A Criminal Appeal (CRL.A) is a legal proceeding initiated by a person convicted of a crime to have their case reviewed by a higher court. The convicted person (the "appellant") argues that the trial court made a legal error that led to an incorrect judgment. The appeal is not a new trial; rather, the appellate court reviews the record of the trial court proceedings to determine if any reversible errors were made. The State can also file an appeal to challenge an acquittal or to argue for a more severe sentence. In this case, the appeal is against a conviction under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with the punishment for murder.</p>

        <h4>ORDERS OF THE COURT</h4>

        <div class="order">
            <p class="order-title">Bail application rejected</p>
            <p class="order-meta">Order | Date: 19-07-2024</p>
            <div class="order-content">
                <p>This is an application seeking suspension of the sentence and grant of bail to the Appellant during the pendency of the present appeal. The Appellant has been convicted by the learned Sessions Judge for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and has been sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life. Considering the gravity of the offence and the evidence on record, this Court is not inclined to grant the relief prayed for at this stage. The application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail is accordingly dismissed.</p>
