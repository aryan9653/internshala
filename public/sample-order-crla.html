            <h2>Understanding a Criminal Appeal (CRL.A)</h2>
            <p>A <strong>Criminal Appeal (CRL.A)</strong> is a formal request made to a higher court to review a decision made by a lower court in a criminal case. The appellant (the party filing the appeal, usually the convicted person) argues that the trial court made a legal error that affected the outcome of the case. Common grounds for appeal include misinterpretation of law, improper admission or exclusion of evidence, or that the conviction was not supported by the evidence presented. The High Court has the power to uphold the conviction, overturn it (acquit the appellant), or order a retrial.</p>

            <h2>Orders of the Court</h2>
            
            <div class="order-item">
                <strong>Bail application rejected</strong>
                <p class="meta">Type: order | Date: 19-07-2024</p>
                <p>The application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail is dismissed after considering the gravity of the offence and the evidence on record. The court finds no sufficient grounds to suspend the sentence pending the final disposal of the appeal.</p>
                <div class="purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> In a criminal appeal, the appellant can request the court to suspend their sentence and release them on bail until the appeal is decided. This order indicates that the court reviewed the request but denied it, meaning the appellant will remain in custody while the appeal is being heard. This is common in cases involving serious offenses like murder.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="order-item">
                <strong>Admit appeal and call for records</strong>
                <p class="meta">Type: notice | Date: 12-06-2024</p>
                <p>The appeal is admitted for hearing. The registry is directed to call for the trial court records, including the evidence and judgment, to enable the court to hear the appeal. Notice of appeal is formally served on the State.</p>
                 <div class="purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This is a crucial first step in the appeal process. 'Admitting' the appeal means the court has found that there are valid legal questions to be considered. By 'calling for trial court records,' the High Court ensures it has all the necessary documents from the original trial to properly review the case and the arguments made by the appellant.</p>
