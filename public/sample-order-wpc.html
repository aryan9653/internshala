            <h2>Understanding W.P.(C) - Writ Petition (Civil)</h2>
            <p>A Writ Petition (Civil) is a formal written order from a court, in this case, the High Court. It is filed to enforce fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. This type of petition is used when a citizen or entity believes their rights have been violated by the state or a government body. In a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), like this case, the petition is filed for the protection of public interest, such as pollution, terrorism, and road safety.</p>

            <h2>Orders of the Court</h2>
            
            <div class="order-item">
                <p class="order-meta">Title: Direction to file status report | Type: order | Date: 22-07-2024</p>
                <p>Respondents are directed to file a detailed status report on the measures taken to comply with environmental norms within four weeks. The report should be supported by an affidavit from a senior official not below the rank of Joint Secretary.</p>
                <div class="order-purpose">
                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This directive is crucial for the court to understand the current situation and the actions taken by the government so far. By asking for a sworn affidavit, the court ensures accountability and the authenticity of the information provided. It's a standard step in PILs to gather facts before making further decisions.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="order-item">
                <p class="order-meta">Title: Notice issued | Type: notice | Date: 18-06-2024</p>
                <p>Issue notice to all concerned parties. Reply to be filed within four weeks. The petitioner is directed to supply a complete set of the petition to the respondents through their counsel. The matter is listed for further hearing on 22-07-2024.</p>
                <div class="order-purpose">
                     <p><strong>Purpose of the Order:</strong> This is the initial step in any court case. The 'notice' formally informs the respondents (the government bodies in this case) that a case has been filed against them. This adheres to the principle of 'audi alteram partem' (hear the other side), a cornerstone of natural justice. It gives the respondents a fair opportunity to present their side of the story.</p>
